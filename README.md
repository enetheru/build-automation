## Build Automation

I found myself repeating things, so I scripted it.

This is mainly for me tracking my things, but if it helps anyone else that's fine.


## TODO

* Replace action calls with action code to make scripts standalone
* make resulting configuration structure queryable
* fix rich formatting on subprocesses
* process the logs to filter the compile results.
* Flatten Structure - continue
* respond to keyboard interrupt as a means to cancel remaining jobs and return
    stats.


## Notes: 
ytnuf's godot-cpp vcpkg
https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/37931

I have to create projects using vcpkg and conan to see if anything needs to change.
